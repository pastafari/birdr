<span class="label label-info">Notes</span>

This question refers to the color of feathers and ignores legs and bill. 

The plumage of many birds is either <highlight> brown  or  brown and white</highlight>, and  they are often among the hardest to  identify. 

So ,if  a bird at first seems to be entirely  brown or brown/white, always look carefully  to see  if any other color is present.  

<span class="label label-warning">Important</span>
If you noticed only brown or brown/white, go to <a href="question-4.html">4</a>. 

Otherwise , ignore these two colors completely, and decide which other color was present or predominant . Note that some birds seem to be black but  are dark blue or brown in the  hand, these are found by following black.
