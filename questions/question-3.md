This question refers to the colour of feathers and ignores legs and bill. The plumage of many birds is either  brown  or  brown and white, and  they are often among the hardest to  identify. So ,if  a bird at first seems to be entirely  brown or brown/white, always look carefully  to see  if any other colour is present.  If you noticed only brown or brown/white,turn now to 4. Otherwise , ignore these two colours completely, and decide which other colour was present or predominant . Note that some birds seem to be black but  are dark blue or brown in the  hand, these are found by following black.
