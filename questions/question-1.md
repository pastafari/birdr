In a great majority of cases ,the answer will be self-evident.  

If the bird was swimming or wading , it was certainly a water bird. And  it was certainly a water bird if it was on the shore ( sea ,lake or river) or flying low over it;if it was on or near cliffs or flying over the sea ; in bushes,reeds or rushes beside water; or on mudflats. 

If it was nowhere near water ,it was certainly a land . In marginal  cases , you will come to know by instinct which answer is right . Some birds , such as gulls are seen in both the habitats and  will be reached whichever answer is chosen.
