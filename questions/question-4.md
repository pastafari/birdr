<span class="label label-info">Notes</span>

All small birds have bills which are noticeably either thin and slender or comparatively thick and heavy.
The shape of the bill is a useful point of recognition and you should train yourself to look for it,   
especially with these small brownish birds.

If you canâ€™t make up your mind then follow up the bird under both answers ,first one then the other.
